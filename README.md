A-Life Simulation in Golang

Overview

This project is an A-life (Artificial Life) simulation implemented in Golang, leveraging the power of multithreading to create a dynamic and efficient simulation environment.

Features

Agent-based Simulation: The simulation is agent-based, with each agent having its own behavior, characteristics, and interactions with the environment and other agents.
